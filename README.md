# 🌱 Green Spark – Hack for Impact (Elimination Round)

Welcome to the **Green Spark: Hack for Impact** pre-event elimination round.  
This is your gateway to qualify for the final offline hackathon by showcasing a working tech solution built under time pressure.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

**How might we build and deploy technology-driven solutions that actively promote cleaner, greener communities and environmental sustainability?**  
You're expected to build a functional prototype, not just an idea. Address real-world problems like:

- Waste management or reduction
- Sustainable mobility or energy use
- Eco-friendly habits
- Carbon footprint tracking
- Awareness and behavioral nudges

- Think user interfaces for awareness, habit tracking, community actions, or creative public engagement – all through front-end magic.

> **NB:** Front-end only is enough. You can use any tools like HTML/CSS/JS, React, Tailwind, or even Figma for mockups.
